# continuous delivery and change management

both devops and ITIL have best practices for bringing software changes in production.

## goals

- stable products
- products that are fit for purpose
- short lead time (metric from the devops world), adequate time-to-market for new products (universally applicable)

## what devops says

- small, frequent changes
- fully automated ci/cd pipeline
- canary or blue/green deployment
- infrastructure-as-code

## what itil says

- different change types (normal, standard and emergency changes)
- risk assessment
- approval boards / change advisory boards
- segregation of duties 

## best of both approach

# incident management

incident management is a formal process in ITIL, whereas it is a necessary practice in DevOps to handle anomalies in production. as a generalization one might say that ITIL focuses on the incident itself; DevOps, on the other hand, emphasises the learning aspect of unexpected behavior in production. therefore, it could be stated that DevOps relies on resilience engineering: proactive measures to decrease the probability of defects and increase the probability of finding remedies for defects within short time frames. ITIL prescribes a process for handling defects and anomalies but does not really focus on proactive measures (but to be fair ITIL also does not discourage proactive practices).

# some more aspects from real life to make it even more interesting

## COBIT management framework to complicate things
- enterprise governance framework
- strong focus on structure, processes, services, policies, competencies
- top management loves it (for covering their asses)
- integrates well with ITIL (and, therefore, these two together outnumber DevOps in enterprises aiming at combining them all)

## regulatory requirements (applies to highly regulated industry sectors)
- regulators require adherence to standards
- regulators / auditors love COBIT and ITIL
- regulators / auditors value documentation more than knowledge
